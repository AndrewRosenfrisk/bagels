# Bagels

## About

In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues. 
The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess: 
1. “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place, 
2. “Fermi” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place, 
3. and “Bagels” if your guess has no correct digits.

You have 10 tries to guess the secret number.
